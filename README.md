# face-recognition
This project is built on python, and is about recognizing human faces and their various applications. 
KNN Algorithm is used here(both from scratch and sklearn library)	      
	
	
	
# Requirements :

* Libraries : Numpy , Sklearn, Opencv
* Make an empty folder 'all_faces' in same directory.
* Droidcam  mobile app (Optional) :
				Install droidcam on your system too and run droidcam & on terminal.(Connect phone and laptop by same server)
				
				
				
# Various applications:

* This can be used  to know about which friend of yours is using or used your smartphone, in your absence. 
It can be implemented by using an app DROIDCAM which can broadcast the faces  coming infront of your mobile's front camera. 
And then using these faces, you can run this model to recognize the names of your friends who used it,
or you can use TWILIO API to send an email or push message automatically to you regarding the information of differnent persons
who have used it.

* This can be useful for security purposes like deploying a camera phone to recognize persons arriving there . 
 
* This can also be useful in recognizing guest's faces at your doorstep 
....and many more.
